# Welcome to ToNI

The Toronto Neuroimaging (ToNI) facility is a shared research center at the University of Toronto, dedicated to neuroimaging research and teaching.  ToNI is managed by the University of Toronto Department of Psychology.

This website provides technical documentation and tutorials for using the resources at ToNI and is targeted towards neuroscience/neuropsychology researchers who are interested in conducting research at ToNI.

## Safety and Emergencies

The nature of MRI scanners makes them very dangerous if strict safety protocols are not followed. Safety is our paramount concern at ToNI, so that groundbreaking research to take place in a healthy way while keeping both participants and experimenters safe. To maintain this atmosphere of safety, please read through our general [safety policies](https://toni.psych.utoronto.ca/safety/).

Even in environments where safety is the number one priority, emergencies can take place. In the event of an emergency, please be aware of and refer to the ToNI emergency procedures.

!!! warning "Emergency procedures"

    In the event of an emergency, follow these specific [emergency procedures](https://toni.psych.utoronto.ca/safety/#8).

## Facilities

The ToNI facility resides in the University of Torontoâ€™s Centre for Biological Timing and Cognition, located at 325 Huron St., Toronto, ON, Canada. The centre is also connected via an alternative entrance to the first floor of the Ramsay Wright building.

## Siemens Prisma 3T MRI System

In October of 2017, ToNI installed a Siemens Prisma 3T MRI scanner. The Prisma was designed by Siemens with the research community in mind. It is the fastest whole-body 3T scanner of its class that is commercially available, making it ideal for EPI imaging (both BOLD- and diffusion-weighted imaging). Our scanner enables access to the most recently developed imaging technologies, including Simultaneous Multi-Slice acquisition for faster acquisition (shorter TR and/or increased resolution). In addition, we offer the Siemens Spectroscopy Package, which bundles Single Voxel Spectroscopy, 2D Chemical Shift Imaging, 3D Chemical Shift Imaging, and syngo Spectroscopy Evaluation. We also have access to work-in-progress packages, including multi-echo acquisition for better signal in brain regions prone to susceptibility artifacts, including frontal and temporal regions. More details can be found here: [Prisma 3T](system.md)
