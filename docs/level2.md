After completing a scan session:
1. Transfer all data to echo
2. Ensure that all files were successfully transferred by... (is there a standard method that is used for this? e.g., looking at number of files and total file size on disk? Or perhaps the control computer notes if there are errors in transfer?)

## Control computer disk usage
All scans older than 30 days can be removed from the control computer.
