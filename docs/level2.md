# MR Technologist / Level 2 User Policies

## General scanning procedures

...TODO...

After completing a scan session:
1. Transfer all data to echo
2. Ensure that all files were successfully transferred by... (is there a standard method that is used for this? e.g., looking at number of files and total file size on disk? Or perhaps the control computer notes if there are errors in transfer?)

## Incidental findings
Level 2 users assume the responsibility of checking for and reporting potential incidential findings for any scan session they are running. This includes sessions for their own projects and sessions they are running for other projects. If you are a level 2 user for a session, incidental findings reporting is your responsibility. 

### Incidental findings reporting
If you find a potential incidental finding, please email [psy.mri.physicist@utoronto.ca](mailto:psy.mri.physicist@utoronto.ca) with the subject line: "ToNI incidental finding report" and include the study information (i.e., study name, participant ID number, and date) and the image series number containing the potential incidental findings. 

## Control computer disk usage
The control computer has limited disk space for holding recently collected data. The data policy at ToNI is that after data from a scan session has been successfully tranferred to echo, the data on the control computer will remain for 30 days, after which it can be deleted. In this 30 day window, it is the responsibility of each project's users to confirm that the data transferred to echo is complete and without errors.
