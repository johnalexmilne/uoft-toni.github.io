## Sensimetrics S14 Earphones System



## Optoacoustic OptoActive II System

The OptoActive II system provides both clear audio communication between the participant and control room and noise cancellation for EPI sequences. 

How to use the OptoActive II:

1. Turn on the console by flipping the switch in the back:
2. The OptoActive computer (shown below) turns on when the console is switched on. Make sure the blue LED light on the front of this computer is lit (as shown in the image below). If it isn't, check the power button in the top right. If that button is depressed (i.e., pushed in), push it to release it so it is flush with the surface of the panel. The LED light should turn on and the system will then be ready.
