These systems include stimulus computers running both OSX and Windows platforms.</p> <ul> <li>Stimulus presentation: To display visual stimuli to participants in the MRI scanner, we use a BOLDscreen display. Our BOLDscreen monitor is an MR compatible screen with high resolution (32\u201d, 1920x1080, 100Hz or 120Hz refresh rate) and zero delay. The displays are calibrated to obtain high-fidelity psychophysical measurements in the MR scanner. For stimulus presentation, a PC running Windows or a user owned experiment laptop is used for visual presentation. Matlab, PsychToolbox, E-Prime, Presentation, PsychoPy, and Inquisit are available and supported.</li> <li>Behavioural responses: We routinely collect behavioral responses during fMRI experiments, using different button boxes and a joystick. The buttons emulate key presses on the computer. Our standard button box is a 4-button keypad that has been specially designed for use in an MR scanner (Current Designs, HHSC-1X4-CR). We also have a bimanual option in the form of two 4-button hand-held response pads (Current Designs, HHSC-2X4-N4), as well as a hand-held joystick response device (Current Designs, HHSC-JOY-5).</li> <li>Audio equipment: Auditory stimulation can be delivered to a subject in the MRI scanner in several ways. One option is the conventional Siemens air-driven headset. In addition, for auditory experiments requiring a very flat frequency response and fine control of low-level auditory characteristics, the center has a set of in-ear MRI-compatible headphones (Sensimetrics, model S14) that have been modified to provide excellent isolation from scanner noise. The earphones are small enough to fit within a small head coil, including our 32- and 64-channel head coils.</li> <li>Eye tracking: Eye-position is routinely monitored in the MRI scanner with an infrared camera equipped with a telephoto lens, designed specially for use in the MRI scanner (SR Research, EyeLink 1000 Plus). The system consists of a camera, mirror system, and dedicated host computer running the EyeLink OS. The camera that rests in the bore of the scanner is focused on either eye, first through a two-way coated \u2018hot\u2019 mirror that allows the camera to see the eye while appearing transparent to the subject, and then through the same mirror that subjects use to view the visual display. The specifications on this system are as follows:<ul> <li>Sampling and output rates: 500/1000/2000 Hz</li> <li>System accuracy: 0.25 \u2013 0.5 degrees of visual angle</li> <li>Visual angle resolution: less than 0.01 degrees of visual angle</li> <li>Tracking range: 32 degrees horizontally, 25 degrees vertically.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Physiological measures: Complex physiological signals in the MRI can be collected using the Biopac system available at ToNI. This system permits the acquisition of several physiological signals, including: Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyogram (EMG), Respiration, blood pressure, and Electrodermal activities such as Galvanic skin response (GSR). These signals can serve as valuable measures of nervous system function in different experimental designs. Electrical stimulation is also available for constant current and constant voltage electrical stimulation. Collected data can be analyzed using Acqknowledge software, which provides an environment to view, record, analyze, and transfer data. Cardiac signal can also be recorded using Siemens Bluetooth-enabled pulse oximeter that clips to the index finger of the subject. Respiration can be recorded using a Siemens pneumatic respiratory belt. These physiological signals may be used to correct for artifacts, physiological alterations, induced field inhomogeneity, or interference with the experiment.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"facilities/#mock-scanner-room","title":"Mock Scanner Room","text":"<p>Shells of a previously active 1.5T Siemens Avanto scanner are used to build an MRI simulator or \u201cmock\u201d scanner.

These sessions are free of charge and are intended to test pulse sequences, experiment programs, timing, responses, etc. Users will be able to book sessions themselves through Calpendo after registering a new experiment. These sessions should always be completed with the MR technologist (not a Level 2 Operator) as Pilot Sessions are also be used to estimate the length of Research Sessions as well as setup and cleanup requirements.</li> <li>Research Sessions: Following piloting, users can book sessions through Calpendo for research scans. These sessions are booked and billed according to ToNI\u2019s standard policies.</li> <li>Development Sessions: Occasionally, users may want to develop qualitatively new scanning protocols for an upcoming study. In these cases, several sessions worth of data must be acquired to optimize parameters. Users should consult with the MR Physicist to determine whether their new protocol would be of general interest to members of the ToNI community.

The actively shielded magnet has zero helium boil-off technology, reducing maintenance costs and downtime. The RF system has up to 128 channels in the magnet housing for increased SNR. The 20- and 32-channel head and 64-channel head/neck coils with integrated pre-amplifiers allows parallel acquisition techniques and image acceleration, reducing susceptibility distortion and image blurring in EPI while maintaining an excellent SNR. Our state-of-the-art scanner enables access to the most recently developed imaging technologies, including Simultaneous Multi-Slice acquisition for faster acquisition (shorter TR and/or increased resolution). In addition, we offer the Siemens Spectroscopy Package, which bundles Single Voxel Spectroscopy, 2D Chemical Shift Imaging, 3D Chemical Shift Imaging, and syngo Spectroscopy Evaluation.
